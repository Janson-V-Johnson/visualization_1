# Healthcare Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes a healthcare dataset, focusing on financial metrics like **Average Covered Charges**, **Average Total Payments**, and **Average Medicare Payments**. The goal is to visualize and understand the distribution of these values across different Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs).

## Project Overview

The analysis involves several steps, including:
1. **Data Filtering and Aggregation**: Filtering data where `Average Total Payments` is less than 5000 and grouping by `DRG Definition`.
2. **Visualization**: Using bar plots, pie charts, and histograms to better understand the data.
3. **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics to summarize key metrics in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **DRG Definition**: Descriptions of the Diagnosis-Related Groups.
- **Total Discharges**: The number of discharges for each DRG.
- **Average Covered Charges**: The average amount covered by charges.
- **Average Total Payments**: The average total payments made.
- **Average Medicare Payments**: The average amount paid by Medicare.
